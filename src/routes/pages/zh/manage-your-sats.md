## Bitcoin Basics

This guide is meant to be a very basic introductory guide so we will only barely scratch the surface of Bitcoin here but there are a few very imprtant things to know about the zaps your send and receive in Nostr.

1. The sats that you're zapping back and forth in Notsr are Bitcoin.
1. Satoshis (sats) are the subdividing units of Bitcoin. There are 100,000,000 satsoshis in a whole Bitcoin.
1. Bitcoin is a bearer instrument, which means that whoever holds it, owns it. There is no recourse or insurance if your bitcoin ends up in someone else's hands.

## Wallet Basics

There are many different bitcoin wallets out there but you can divide them into two categories; custodial and self-custodial.

**Custodial wallets:** With custodial wallets you're trading convenience for certainty. They are called custodial wallets because the company or developer that is running the wallet is the ultimate owner (or custodian) of all the Bitcoin of all the users using that wallet.

When you use a custodial wallet, you're trusting the wallet developer not to rug you and steal your funds. This happens rarely, but as we've seen recently with many custodial exchanges (Blockfi, Celcius, FTX, etc), counterparty risk is a real danger and something you should be aware of.

**Self-custodial wallets:** Self-custodial wallets are wallets that you, personally, hold the keys to. This means that you have full control, ownership of, and responsibility for the bitcoin in them. If you lose the keys, your coins are lost.

Like all things in life, the question of custodial vs self-custodial is about tradeoffs. Only you can decide whether you feel comfortable trading the convenience of not managing keys (it's really not that hard) for the certainty of holding your own bitcoin.

That said, as a good rule of thumb, think about losing everything you have in Wallet of Satoshi right now. If that idea scares you or makes you feel uncomfortable you should set yourself a goal to switch to self-custody soon. A good place to start is our guide on how to set up a [self-custody](/en/guides/sweep-to-self-custody) wallet for sweeping sats.
