NostrChat is a chat app built on Nostr. With NostrChat, you can start a channel with one or more friends, and be confident that your communications will stay online even in the face of a dramatic effort to censor you.

## Step 2 — Login

### Creating a new account (Easiest)

1. Click "Create Nostr Account"
2. Put in your name, and then click skip
3. Instantly you'll enter a global chat
4. Important: Save your private keys somewhere safe — you'll need these if you want to come back to the app in the future.

### Use a NIP-07 Extension to Login (Recommended)

Alby is a Bitcoin browser extension that manages your public/private keys locally. With a wallet extension like Alby, your private key never leaves your computer, but you can grant access to apps using Alby.

1. Download the [Alby web wallet](https://getalby.com/)
2. Once you're inside Alby, set an unlock password
3. Inside Alby, go to Accounts and generate or add your Nostr public & private keys. Make sure to save these in your password manager.
4. Once you have Alby setup, return to NostrChat.io and login with "NIP-07"

### Step 3 — Create a new chat channel and share with Nostr friends

Once you join NostrChat.io you can chat in the global channel or create a new channel for your project or friends. Just share the URL of the channel with your friends. **IMPORTANT: These channels are all public.** At this time, there isn't a way to make private group chats.

Active development of NostrChat.io is happening on [Github](https://github.com/NostrChat/NostrChat)
