## [§](#keys-events-relays) Keys, Events, and Relays – Oh My!

You've downloaded a nostr client, connected to a few relays, and set up a zapping wallet. Now, you’re ready to start posting notes.

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of posting on nostr: content, media, hashtags, community engagement, and value-for-value :zap:

## [§](#introductory-post) Introductory Post

There are various ways to connect with the communities of nostr, but it never hurts to begin by introducing yourself!

With no character limit on nostr notes, you can feel free to say more than just "hello world". Let people know what brings you to nostr and what you'd like to get out of using the protocol. And don't forget to add a couple of hashtags – such as #introductions – to help people see your post, even if they aren't following you already. 

In nostr's early days, it could be difficult to search for specific words or people, but that is quickly changing, with some nostr clients (like Damus) introducing more robust search functionality.

## [§](#utilizing-hashtags) Utilizing hashtags

Hashtags can be searched and followed in many nostr clients, which makes them a great way to find content that interests you, as well as putting your notes in front of other like-minded users. 

At the time of this writing, the hashtag #grownostr is a general hashtag, used for a wide range of topics. (Since nostr was built by bitcoiners, there is a lot of bitcoin-related discussion, so #grownostr helps users find other subjects to discuss – remember, it's still early). 

Other popular hashtags include #nature, #artstr, and #introductions and #plebchain for finding new users to connect with.

Use whichever words help you find interesting content. You can also try adding "-str" to the end, so if you're looking for cute cat images, search for #catstr :cat2:

## [§](#posting-media) Posting images and other media

Who doesn't love sharing their favorite photos with friends!?

Most mobile clients offer easy ways to upload images or videos. Usually, when creating a note, you'll see a camera/photo icon to select a photo from your camera roll. Use that to add an image or video to your post. To add gifs, most clients will display a gif correctly if you just paste a .gif URL.

For the tech-curious: the way that media functions on nostr "under the hood" is a bit different than on traditional social/media. The protocol doesn't actually support images, so clients have to find a workaround. Typically, clients upload the image to a hosting site such as [Nostr.build](nostr.build), and then the client asks that server to return the image when needed.

In the early days of nostr, users had to manually upload the image to the hosting site, then copy/paste the hosting URL into their note. Client developers quickly began rendering those URLs, and now the clients typically handle the whole process.

Fun fact: Nostr.build strips all metadata from your image before uploading it, so you don't leak massive amounts of personal data with every image you post, the way that you would on Twitter or Instagram. Privacy by default!


## [§](#getting-un-stuck) Posting into the void?

Visibility: relays, plebchain follow-for-follow, repost your own notes (sparingly), and most importantly: engage with other users!
