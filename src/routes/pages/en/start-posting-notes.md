## [§](#keys-events-relays) Keys, Events, and Relays – Oh My!

You've downloaded a nostr client, connected to a few relays, and set up a zapping wallet. Now, you’re ready to start posting notes.

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of posting on nostr: content, media, hashtags, community engagement, and value-for-value :zap:

## [§](#introductory-post) Introductory Post

There are various ways to connect with the communities of nostr, but it never hurts to begin by introducing yourself!

With no character limit, you can say more than just "hello world". Let people know how you found nostr and why you're here. And don't forget to add a couple of hashtags, such as #introductions, to help people see your post. 

In nostr's early days, it could be difficult to search for specific words or people, but that is quickly changing with some nostr clients introducing more robust search functionality. One of the best ways to discover new content is by using and following hashtags.

## [§](#utilizing-hashtags) Utilizing hashtags

Hashtags are supported in most nostr clients. It's great way to find content that interests you, as well as showing your posts to other users that you haven't connected with before. 

At the time of this writing, the hashtag #grownostr is a popular catch-all, used for a wide range of topics. (Since nostr was built by bitcoiners, there is still a lot of bitcoin-related discussion, so we use #grownostr to identify various other topics). 

A few other popular hashtags include #nature, #artstr, #photography, #foodstr, #dogstr, and #AiArt, for example. Search or post with #introductions and #plebchain to find new friends.

Ultimaetly, you can Use any hashtags that help you find interesting content. If you don't see much, try adding "-str" to the end. For example, if you're looking for cute cat photos, search for #catstr :cat2:


## [§](#tagging-other-users) Tagging Other Users

Tagging other users is still a work in progress (as of this writing in early 2024). On most clients, if you're already following someone, then using @ followed by their display name will work. Of course, if you use @ followed by their npub, that's a surefire way to tag your friend (but of course that assumes you have already saved their npub to your clipboard).


## [§](#posting-media) Posting images and other media

Who doesn't love sharing their favorite photos with friends!?

Most mobile clients offer easy ways to upload images or videos. When drafting a new note, look for a camera icon to select a photo from your camera roll. 

To add gifs, most clients will display a gif correctly if you just paste the URL into your note. (Make sure the URL ends with .gif for it to show up the best).

For the tech-curious: the way that media functions on nostr "under the hood" is a bit different than on traditional social/media. The protocol doesn't actually support images, and most relays don't accept them, so clients have to find a workaround. Typically, clients upload the image to a hosting site such as [Nostr.build](nostr.build) on behalf of the user, and then the client requests the image from that server and renders it locally, when needed.

In the early days of nostr, users had to manually upload the image to the hosting site, then copy/paste the hosting URL into their note. Client developers quickly found ways to display the images, and now most clients handle images beautifully.

Fun fact: Nostr.build strips all metadata from your image before uploading it, so you don't leak massive amounts of personal data with every image you post, as you would on Twitter or Instagram. Privacy by default is somewhat of a holy grail for Nostriches, so don't hesitate to show our friends over at nostr.build some support. 


## [§](#getting-un-stuck) Posting into the void?

Do you feel like nobody is seeing your notes? At first, it can certainly feel like that. But the truth is that we're thrilled that you've decided to check out Nostr, and it just takes a little time to get connected with people. Here are the top five ways to increase your visibility and engage with other uers:

1. Relays. Make sure you're connected to a handful of popular public relays, or, better yet, connect to a couple of high-quality paid relays. They're typically inexpensive (sometimes as little as a hundred sats) and offer one of the best ways to reduce spam in your feed. Because of this fact, many experienced nostr users _only_ read from paid relays. [You can learn more about relays here](https://nostr.how/en/relays).

2. Visibility. As mentioned above, try a few hashtags like #plebchain or #introductions to start building a network of friends and followers.

3. Follow. Follow everyone who catches your interest. Remember how traditional social media limits how many people you can follow, and even "stigmatizes" users with a high "following" count? **NOSTR IS DIFFERENT.** The more people you follow, the more interesting and diverse your experience will be. And you can always unfollow someone if you decide you dislike their content.

4. Repost. You can repost your own notes. Do this sparingly, but if you had a great note that you realize you posted when all your friends were asleep, go ahead and repost it. Without algorithms, most notes have (at most) a 24-hour engagement period. Repost if you feel a good note got overlooked. We are all the algorithm.

5. Engage! This might be the best way to connect with people. Reply to people's notes. Zap content that brings you value. Repost something that made you laugh. Participate in threads and share the gifts that you have to contribute to the world. Your nostr circle will grow organically.
