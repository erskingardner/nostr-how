## [§](#keys-events-relays) Keys, Events, and Relays – Oh My!

So, now that you've downloaded a nostr client – and connected to a few relays, and set up a zapping wallet – you’re probably excited to start posting notes.

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of posting on nostr: content/quality, media, hashtags, community engagement, and value-for-value :zap:

## [§](#introductory-post) Introductory Post

There are various ways to connect with the communities of nostr, but it never hurts to begin by introducing yourself!

With no character limit on nostr notes, you can feel free to say more than just "hello world". Let people know what brings you to nostr and what you'd like to get out of using the protocol. And don't forget to add a couple of hashtags – such as #introductions – to help people see your post, even if they aren't following you already. (More on visibility/engagement later on).
