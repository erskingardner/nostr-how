## [§](#keys-events-relays) Keys, Events, and Relays – Oh My!

So, now that you've downloaded a nostr client – and connected to a few relays, and set up a zapping wallet – you’re probably excited to start posting notes.

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of posting on nostr: content/quality, media, hashtags, community engagement, and value-for-value :zap:

## [§](#introductory-post) Introductory Post

There are various ways to connect with the communities of nostr, but it never hurts to begin by introducing yourself!

With no character limit on nostr notes, you can feel free to say more than just "hello world". Let people know what brings you to nostr and what you'd like to get out of using the protocol. And don't forget to add a couple of hashtags – such as #introductions – to help people see your post, even if they aren't following you already. (More on visibility/engagement later on).

## [§](#utilizing-hashtags) Utilizing hashtags

Hashtags can be searched and followed in many nostr clients, which makes them a great way to find content that interests you, as well as putting your notes in front of other like-minded users. 

At the time of this writing, the hashtag #grownostr is a general hashtag, used for a wide range of topics. (Since nostr was built by bitcoiners, there is a lot of bitcoin-related discussion, so #grownostr helps users find other subjects to discuss – remember, it's still early). 

Other popular hashtags include #nature, #artstr, and #introductions and #plebchain for finding new users to connect with.

Use whichever words help you find interesting content. You can also try adding "-str" to the end, so if you're looking for cute cat images, search for #catstr :cat2:
