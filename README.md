## üê£ Getting started with the codebase

Nostr.how is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a lightweight javascript framework.

1. Clone this repo.
1. Install the dependencies `npm install`
1. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
1. Access the site in development at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## üö® IMPORTANT

If you were a previous contributor to Nostr.how I have rewritten the site from Next.js to Svelte (change effective Apr 13 2023). Please double check that your local copy is up to date and accurate.

## ü´Ç Contributing

We're always looking for writers, coders, and translators to help us make Nostr.how more useful. A few more details below on how you can contribute. If you have an idea on how to make the site better in any way, [please let me know](https://snort.social/p/npub1zuuajd7u3sx8xu92yav9jwxpr839cs0kc3q6t56vd5u9q033xmhsk6c2uc).

### Create or Edit content

If you recently learned something new about Nostr it's likely that other people don't know it yet! Writing new content for Nostr.how is easy. Feel free to write in whatever format you'd like and then [reach out to me on Nostr](https://snort.social/p/npub1zuuajd7u3sx8xu92yav9jwxpr839cs0kc3q6t56vd5u9q033xmhsk6c2uc) and I'll get the page into the codebase (or, if you're technical, feel free to create a PR directly).

If you're less of a writer but have a sharp eye for typos and grammar, feel free to [create issues here in Github](https://github.com/erskingardner/nostr-how/issues) for things you find that could be improved.

### Translations

Translations in Nostr.how are done in two parts. For UI elements and navigation items we use in i18n library and simple JSON files to store the translated strings. The main content of each page is written in Markdown and each page must be translated separately and put into the correct directory in the codebase.

#### Getting started

The best workflow for working on a translation is to first fork this repository and create a branch on your own forked copy. This makes it easy to open a PR for feedback while you continue working on translating all the pages. Let's see how it's done:

##### CLONING THE REPO

1. First, you'll need to have a github account, so set that up first.
1. Then, on the Nostr.how repo page, you want to click the "Fork" button at the top of the page. ![fork-me](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/202880/257783964-487d525c-beec-46ae-b48f-0458cf3656b2.png)
1. This will create a new copy of the repo under your account on Github.
1. Next you'll want to clone that new forked copy to your local computer. On the terminal, run the following command. (don't copy the `$` at the beginning of the command)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/nostr-how.git
```

##### CREATE A NEW BRANCH

Congrats üéâ you now have a local copy of the repository set up and ready to use. Let's get a new branch set up for your translation.

1. On the terminal again, run `$ git checkout -b <LANGUAGE>_translation`, if you have trouble running this command you might not have `git` installed.
1. Creating a new branch to work from means that you keep all your work separate and organized.
1. Now, go ahead and open up a text editor and start hacking you code cowboy!

##### CREATING A PULL REQUEST (PR)

1. Once you've made a few changes you can commit those changes by running `git commit -am 'A short commit message about what you've changed'` ‚Äì¬†you should replace the message part with a short note about what you've changed.
1. Each commit that you make is like saving your game. You can always easily restore the state of your code to those commit points whenever you'd like.
1. After you've made a few commits, you can push your changes to github with `git push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME>` (remember to change that to the real name of your branch).
1. Once you've done this you can navigate to the "Pull requests" tab at the top of your repo in Github.
1. Press the big green "New Pull Request" button at the top right of the page and then double check that you have the right branches selected. Below is an example of how it should look if want to create a pull request for the branch on my fork of a repo back to the main branch of the source repo.
   ![compare](https://cdn.nostr.build/p/3vyX.png)
1. That's it. Once you've created a pull request you can continue working and pushing changes to your own branch and your pull request will continue to update with each new commit.
1. Once the PR is completely ready, I'll merge it and we'll celebrate! üéâ

#### i18n JSON files

These files are found in the `/src/lib/locales/` directory [here](https://github.com/erskingardner/nostr-how/tree/main/src/lib/locales). Each new language needs to have it's own file named with the ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code. E.g. `en.json` for English and `it.json` for Italian.

Currently we're **_not_** creating sub-localizations for regions, e.g. `en-gb.json` for the UK as distinct from the United States.

To translate these files, copy the `en.json` file and change only the values, not the keys, of each item.

![JSON file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/202880/231967087-5f66846b-f76b-42d2-b0f5-37a2dd8778a2.png)

#### Markdown pages

Each of the individual pages of content are in the `/src/routes/pages` directory [here](https://github.com/erskingardner/nostr-how/tree/main/src/routes/pages). The pages for each language are in a folder with the corresponding Alpha-2 two letter code for that language.

Here's how to create files for a new language:

1. Create a new folder with the 2 letter country code as the name. E.g. `/src/routes/pages/es/` for Spanish.
1. Create blank files **with the same names** as the files in the `/src/routes/pages/en/` (english) directory. It's important that the names are exactly the same so that they can be dynamically loaded.
1. Translate each page.
    1. The section at the top (between the `---`) is called Frontmatter and it's really important that the formatting stays the same. Please don't change the `title` or `description` keys, but definitely translate the text after.
    1. The full page should be translated to your target language.
    1. For URLs to other pages, please change the two letter country code to your target language. e.g. `/en/get-started` should change to `/fr/get-started` if you're translating to French.
    1. It's ok to change the anchor links for each header to the target language. These make it easy for people to link to specific parts of the page. e.g. `## [¬ß](#understanding-keys)` should chance to something like `## [¬ß](#compendere-chiavi)` if you're translating to Italian.
    1. That's it.
1. If you'd like to add any images or create new images specific for a given language please [get in touch](https://snort.social/p/npub1zuuajd7u3sx8xu92yav9jwxpr839cs0kc3q6t56vd5u9q033xmhsk6c2uc). I'll be happy to help you add them to the right places.
